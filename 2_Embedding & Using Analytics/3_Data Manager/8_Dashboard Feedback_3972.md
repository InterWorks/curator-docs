# Dashboard Feedback

In order to gather valuable insights from your audience about their experience using your Dashboards, Curator can
provide a simple and easy feedback mechanism for your users to submit their feedback, questions, and requests.  After
following the [Creating a Form](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/embedding-using-analyticsdata-manager/creating-a-form/1504)
outline to build out your desired form, follow the guide below to integrate the Dashboard feedback in to your Dashboard
pages.

## Modifying your for to support the Dashboard URL

In order to gather the context of which Dashboard a user is providing feedback for, you'll need to add a new hidden
field that will store the Dashboard URL (the Curator URL).

### Adding a new Data Attribute

To add this attribute to your form:

1. Go to Data Manager > Data Attributes to set up the fields you want:
    ![Create Data Attribute](https://curator.interworks.com/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/DashFeed4.png)
2. In the Create Attribute page, set the name, description (optional), and the field type.
3. Make sure the field type is set to **Short Text**.

Next, navigate to your Data Manager Group, and associate the Attribute you just created with your Group.
