When experiencing slow performance with Curator, collecting detailed system information helps the support team identify
the root cause. Follow these steps to gather the necessary diagnostic files.

## Step 1: Collect Server Performance Data

Connect to your Curator server via SSH (Linux) or RDP (Windows), then run the performance script for your operating
system to generate a comprehensive report of your server's configuration, performance metrics, and usage statistics.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Linux Servers">
    ```bash
    curl -o /tmp/curator_server_info.sh "https://api.curator.interworks.com/scripts/curator_server_info.sh";
    chmod +x /tmp/curator_server_info.sh && /tmp/curator_server_info.sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows Servers">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://api.curator.interworks.com/scripts/curator_server_info.ps1" -OutFile "$env:TEMP\curator_server_info.ps1";
    PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\curator_server_info.ps1"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
The generated file will contain system information including server configuration, performance metrics,
and usage statistics needed for performance analysis.

## Step 2: Access API Keys Settings

<BackendNavPath
  levelOne="Settings"
  levelTwo="API Keys"
/>

## Step 3: Collect Portal Info Endpoint

1. In the API Keys settings, select **Portal** from the first dropdown.
2. Select **Info** from the second dropdown.
3. Click the generated preview link to open the endpoint in a new tab.
4. Right-click on the page and select **Save As** to save the output to a file.
5. Save the file as `info.json` (save as JSON format, **not PDF**).

## Step 4: Collect Portal PHPInfo Endpoint

1. Take the URL from the previous step and modify it by changing `portal/info` to `portal/phpinfo` in the address bar.
2. Press Enter to load the PHPInfo page.
3. Right-click on the page and select **Save As** to save the output to a file.
4. Save the file as `phpinfo.html` (save as HTML format, **not PDF**).

## Send Files for Analysis

Email the following files to the Curator support team for analysis:

- Server performance data (markdown file from Step 1)
- `info.json` (from Step 3)
- `phpinfo.html` (from Step 4)
- Feel free to include screenshots of any relevant system information.

The support team will analyze these files and provide specific recommendations to improve your system's performance.
