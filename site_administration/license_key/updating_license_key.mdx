Adding or updating your license key is only required for new installations, or migrations that have failed to
carry over your license key.  Typical license keys are allowed on up to 3 instances so long as only one
instance is used for Production.  If you'd like to deploy multiple Curator sites, please talk to your Account
Executive about our Enterprise offering.

## How to Update your License Key

In order to add or update your license key, follow the steps below:

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **System Upgrade** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the pencil "Update Key" link
