To access the backend administration area of your Curator instance, you will need to log in with an account that has
administrative privileges.  Typically this is created in the [initial setup](setup/installation/linux_installation) of
your Curator instance, or by an [existing administrator](site_administration/backend_administrators/overview).

### Logging into the Backend

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the backend URL of your Curator instance. This is usually in the format:
   `https://www.yourcuratorexample.com/backend`.

      alt="Backend login screen"
      />
   </Frame>

2. Enter your administrator username and password in the login form.
