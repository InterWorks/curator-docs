description: 'Automatically provision Tableau Server licenses for users when they access Curator for streamlined license management.'

Tableau allows Administrators to manage their licenses in a way that all users can be added as unlicensed and only
[grant them a license][1] once they are logging into Tableau Server. You can now use this feature through your Curator.
All users that are currently unlicensed will receive a license when trying to log into Curator if you have this feature enabled.

## Note This feature is only available when you either use SAML or OAuth/OpenID for authentication

***To grant license on sign-in with SAML***

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Tableau** > **Tableau Server Settings** section from the left-hand menu.
3. In the Authentication tab, expand the **SAML Advanced** section and enable the "License Users if Unlicensed" toggle.
