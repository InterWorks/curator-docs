Two different sync processes run in Curator: the user sync and the group membership sync. In previous versions of Curator, these processes were part of a single sync, but have since been split into two. Separating the one sync into two has led to much greater efficiency. This doc aims to answer frequently asked questions about these syncs and will be updated as new questions are asked.

First, a quick primer on both syncs:

1. **User Sync**:
   - **What is it?** The user sync brings user details from your analytics platforms to Curator. This includes full display name, email address, user roles, etc. This does not include group membership.
   - **When does it happen?** The user sync always happens on login. You can also manually sync a specific user's details from **Curator backend \> Settings \> Users \> Frontend Users**. Select a specific user and use the buttons in the "Platform Users" section to sync the details. _Note: If the user doesn't exist on Curator, the user sync will create it. This results in a lean user base of only the true Curator users._ _Note: You cannot disable the on-login user sync._
2. **Group Membership Sync**:
   - **What is it?** The group membership sync builds Curator Frontend Group membership from a user's platform group membership. For instance, you can create an "Admins" Frontend Group in Curator and, instead of manually selecting numerous users, you can select the "Admins" group from one of your platform connections and Curator will automatically put those users in the Curator Frontend Group. This does not include user details. _Note: This is only relevant if you use Curator Frontend Groups for restricting access in the navigation or for Frontend Group Overrides. If you don't use these features then group membership is irrelevant to Curator._
   - **When does it happen?** Group membership will sync on login by default. Some platforms may have slow response times when Curator requests relevant group memberships, so you can disable the on-login membership sync to speed up the login. If you disable the on-login membership sync, you can enable a sync to occur on a scheduled cadence to ensure users memberships are up to date by the time users login. **_Note: If you disable the on-login membership sync, the scheduled membership sync will create users if they don't already exist on Curator. This is to preemptively ensure the user has their groups before logging in, which requires a Curator user. This is the only scenario where the group membership sync also syncs user details._**

**Where are my Users?** You can find your Frontend Users in **Curator Backend \> Settings \> Users \> Frontend Users**. This page will also show the associated platform-specific users.

**Where are my Groups?** You can find your Frontend Groups in **Curator Backend \> Settings \> Users \> Frontend Groups**. You can trigger group syncs and change sync settings from this page.

**Why would I create groups?** The primary features that leverage Curator Frontend Groups are:

1. [**Restrict Access**](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/site-content-design/menus/restrict-access/1505)**:** You can deny permission to see content in Curator by restricting access in the navigation based on group membership. This is especially helpful for content created in Curator that doesn't have permissions to pull from an analytics platform (e.g. Pages, Files, external URLs, etc.). This can also be useful if your navigation has many items and the permission checks add significant load time. By restricting access to a high-level menu item, you automatically deny access to all of the items nested underneath it, or its 'children.'
2. **Frontend Group Overrides:** Overrides are useful if you have groups of users who require a different look and feel in the Curator frontend. This is common if you have multiple groups/departments or multiple tenants who use different logos, colors, etc. You can also present entirely different navigation structures and homepages to your various groups.

**How do I create groups?** You can create a Frontend Group at **Curator Backend \> Settings \> Users \> Frontend Groups** by using the "New Frontend Group" button. You can build membership by either manually selecting users from the "Group Membership" section or by using a group from one of your connected analytic platforms. For instance, you can create a "Finance" group that uses a Tableau Group and ThoughtSpot Group instead of manually selecting every user who needs to see finance content.

**Curator used to automatically create Frontend Groups that were in Tableau, but not anymore. Why not?** If your Curator instance doesn't leverage restricted access by group or Frontend Group Overrides, then Tableau Groups are irrelevant to Curator and syncing them is unnecessary. Even if you do use a couple of Tableau Groups for Curator Frontend Groups, you likely do not need all of them. In addition, as the analytics platforms available for integration with Curator have increased, syncing and creating all of those groups would create a much less efficient system. Curator's membership syncs are now much leaner and more efficient, resulting in the same functionality with much better performance.

**I created a user in my analytics platform, but it doesnâ€™t show that they are synced in Curator. How do I get Curator to sync a user?** The user will be synced to Curator as soon as they log in. Users are always synced during login. _Caveat: Tableau uses unique user records for each Site a user is a member of. To avoid long login times, Curator only syncs the Tableau User from the Site you've specified in the REST connection (_**_Curator backend \> Integrations \> Connections_**_). The other Site users will be synced on a daily cadence._ _Caveat to the caveat: If you've enabled the Tableau Repository connection, every Site user will be synced on login. Repository queries are much faster than REST API calls, so the login time isn't as affected._
