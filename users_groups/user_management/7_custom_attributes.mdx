# Custom Attributes

With Tableau Cloud, and Tableau versions 2023.1 and above, you can now pass through User Attributes from Curator or your
SAML IdP (e.g. Okta, Azure AD) seamlessly through to your Tableau Dashboards.  This will allow you to use a new calculated
field `USERATTRIBUTE()` in your Dashboard to retrieve the value of the User Attribute and filter your data accordingly.

Note: When a conflict arises due to the same attribute being found in multiple locations, the User attributes will take
highest precedence, followed by Group attributes and then SAML attributes.

## View User's Attributes

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `https://www.curatorexample.com/backend` ).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Users** > **Frontend Users** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Find the user you would like to see from the list using the search options.
4. Expand the "Custom Attributes" section.  At the top you will see the "Resolved Attributes" that take into account
inheritance from all sources.
