Some users want the ability to reset their Tableau Server account password from Curator. The Password Reset
feature can address that issue but will require some additional setup. To use this it is required that you
enable Tableau Server REST API, setup/configure an SMTP Server, enter the SMTP information into Curator and
ensure that the Tableau Server user has an associated email address on their Tableau Server account.

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click on **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** in the left-hand menu.
4. On the **General** tab, scroll to the **Security** section and expand it.
5. Toggle the **Password Reset** switch on and click the "Save" button.
