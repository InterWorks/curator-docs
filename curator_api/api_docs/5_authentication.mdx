# Authentication

## Introduction

Occasionally, various external applications need to rely on Curator to authenticate users for them.
Curator provides a simple interface to determine which user is currently authenticated to Curator,
and provide information to your external application about that user.

This is particularly helpful for applications that need to keep user authentication in sync with Curator,
such as custom applications embedded within Curator.

Retrieving information about the currently authenticated user requires two API calls to Curator:

 1. First, your application must forward the user to Curator's /fetchUser endpoint,
with a `redirect_url` parameter. Curator returns the user to the redirect_url with a `payload`
GET parameter containing a JSON wad containing an identifier token.
 2. Next, use the `token` value from this JSON wad to call Curator's `/user/getUser` endpoint to retrieve the user's information.

## Important Setup

In order for the redirect to work, you must whitelist your domain in the Curator Portal Settings.
Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** section from the left-hand menu.
Under the **General** tab, expand the **Security** section.

## /fetchUser

```HTTP REDIRECT [your_domain]/fetchUser?redirect_url=[group_name_here]```

## /user/getUser

Returns the currently logged in user's information.
```POST [your_domain]/api/v1/User/getUser?apikey=[your_api_key_here]&token=[token_here]```

**Returns:**
array

## Example Authentication Script

```PHP
<?php
/**
 * This is a basic example of how to authenticate a user with Curator.
 *
 * From a flow perspective, this is what happens:
 *     1. The user is redirected to the Curator authentication system. (/fetchUser)
 *     2. The authenticated user is redirected back to this page with a JSON wad in the "payload" GET variable.
 *     3. The JSON wad contains a "token".
 *     4. The token is used against the Curator REST API to get the user's details.
 *
 * NOTE: VERY IMPORTANT:
 *     In order for the redirect to work, you must whitelist your domain in the Curator Portal Settings.
 *     Go to Settings->Curator->Portal Settings to add your domain. (Look under "security")
