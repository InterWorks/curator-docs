# Commands

You can set up custom commands to run by the site. This requires the "Integration" setting to be enabled. To
create a command to be run on a schedule or ad hoc:

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Log in if prompted.
3. Click on the "Integration" link at the top.
4. Click on "Manage Commands" in the left navigation.
5. Click on the "New Command" button at the top of the main page content.
6. Enter the name, description, and command type, arguments, schedule, etc. as needed and click "Create".
