You can follow this guide to connect to your Sigma instance to Curator.

## Preparing Sigma

1. Obtain your Sigma API URL. To determine which URL to use, see Sigma's
[documentation](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/reference/get-started-sigma-api#identify-your-api-request-url).
2. Generate embed client credentials (Client ID and Client Secret) in your Sigma instance. See Sigma's
[documentation](https://help.sigmacomputing.com/docs/generate-embed-client-credentials) for detailed instructions.

## Connect to Curator

1. Go to the backend of your Curator instance. Navigate to **Integrations** > **Connections** using the
left-hand menu.
2. Click the **New Connection** button at the top of the page.
3. Enter a name for the connection (something like "Sigma" is sufficient) and edit the slug if you'd like (but
you don't need to).
4. Choose "Sigma" in the Platform dropdown. If the option is disabled then you already have a Sigma Connection created.
5. Fill out the form that appears below the Platform dropdown:
   - **Sigma API URL**: Select your Sigma API URL from the dropdown, or choose "Manual Entry" to enter a
   custom URL.
   - **Custom Sigma API URL**: If you selected "Manual Entry" above, enter your custom Sigma API URL here.
   - **Sigma Client ID**: The client ID generated from your Sigma embed client credentials.
   - **Sigma Client Secret**: The client secret generated from your Sigma embed client credentials.
6. Hit **Save** at the top of the page.

## Validate Connection

After saving, the connection form will show an authentication check section that verifies your credentials are
working properly with the Sigma API.
