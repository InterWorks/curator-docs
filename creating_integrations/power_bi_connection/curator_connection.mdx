## Creating Curator Connection to Power BI

Note: You will need details from your Azure registered app and your service principal password (if you created a distinct
service principal).  See steps 1-3 above if you have not configured those yet.

If your Curator license allows you to connect to Power BI, you can connect to it by following this process:

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `https://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Integrations** > **Connections** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click the button at the top to create a new connection.
4. From here, fill out the Azure registered app and service principal details, then click save.  All 4 fields need to be
filled in.  If you haven't created a distinct service principal, then re-enter the client secret into the service
principal password field.
5. Refresh the page after saving and you should see a Power BI section show up in the left navigation.

### Validate a successful connection

* The service principal connection was successful if the dropdowns in the backend under **Power BI** > **Reports** >
**Create** a new report populate.
* The client secret connection was successful if the report loads in the frontend.  Be sure to log out of the frontend a
nd log back in fresh.
