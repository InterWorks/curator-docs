## Create a separate Service Principal with Password (Optional)

**NOTE:** In most configurations, the Azure registered app's client secret can be used as the service principal password.
However, if that doesn't work, you may need to use the following steps to create a distinct service principal password.

A service principal is needed to query your Power BI tenant to get lists of dashboards and reports, which aid in easily
publishing those elements to Curator.  These APIs are only available to master accounts and service principals.
A service principal is needed to avoid Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) that may be configured with your master account.

To create a service principal, youâ€™ll need to run the following commands in PowerShell:

1. `Install-Module AzureAD`
2. `Connect-AzureAD`
3. `$sp = New-AzureAdServicePrincipal -Display <Your Desired SP Name Here>`
4. `New-AzureADServicePrincipalPasswordCredential -ObjectId $sp.ObjectId -Value <Your Desired SP Password Here>`

_If you run into permissions errors, you may need your system administrator to run these commands._

**Note:** You can also set other details, such as start and end dates,  for the service principal account and password
by using various PowerShell command parameters.
