## Creating a new Connection

Follow the steps in the
[Tableau Connection Setup](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/setuptableau-connection/rest-api-integration/1089)
section to get connected to your Tableau Server.

## Connected Apps

As of the `01-04-23` Curator release, Tableau's connected apps are now supported as a method of authentication.
This means SSO is no longer required to support a seamless authentication experience for Tableau Cloud users.  All
Tableau Cloud connections in Curator utilize connected apps.  Curator will create a connected app on your Tableau Cloud
site if one doesn't already exist.  You may switch which connected app Curator uses if you need.

For more information and a troubleshooting guide, refer to our article about
 [Creating Integrations: Tableau Connection - Connected Apps](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/creating-integrations/tableau-connection/embed-authentication/3983)

## Custom Domains

In the August 2025 release of Tableau Cloud, Tableau introduced the ability to use custom domains (also known as vanity
URLs). This feature primarily circumvents the need for users to modify their browser's cookie settings to allow
third-party cookies, creating a truly seamless authentication experience when accessing Tableau dashboards via Curator.
_This feature is only available in Curator versions `2025-10-02` and later._

### Setting up a Custom Domain on Tableau Cloud

To set up a custom domain on Tableau Cloud, follow the [instructions provided by Tableau](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/custom_domain.htm).

### Adding your Custom Domain to Curator

Once your custom domain is set up and verified on Tableau Cloud, add your custom domain to Curator  to add it to Curator
to ensure seamless integration.  Begin by navigating to your Tableau Cloud connection in Curator.  Then, follow these
steps:

1. <BackendNavPath
    levelOne="Integrations"
    levelTwo="Connections"
    /> Click on the Tableau connection you'd like to modify.

2. In the **Tableau Connection** section, enter your custom domain URL in the **Custom Domain** field.
3. Confirm that Curator can reach the domain, and that there are no warnings:
    ![Custom Domain Success](/docs_assets/images/creating_integrations/tableau_connection/successful_custom_domain.png)
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Now when users access embedded Tableau Cloud dashboards they will be loaded through your Custom Domain in Curator.
