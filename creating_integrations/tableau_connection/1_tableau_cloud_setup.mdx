## 1. Server Setup

Follow the steps in the
[Tableau Connection Setup](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/setuptableau-connection/rest-api-integration/1089)
section to get connected to your Tableau Server.

## 2. Connected App Setup

As of the `01-04-23` Curator release, Tableau's connected apps are now supported as a method of authentication.
This means SSO is no longer required to support a seamless authentication experience for Tableau Cloud users.  All
Tableau Cloud connections in Curator utilize connected apps.  Curator will create a connected app on your Tableau Cloud
site if one doesn't already exist.  You may switch which connected app Curator uses if you need.
