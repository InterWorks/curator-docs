Sometimes we have dashboards that we don't want to display on the front page or in our search results. In these cases,
we can enable the Hidden switch. When hidden, the Dashboard should only be accessible to those with direct links and if
they have Tableau Server permissions to view the Dashboard. This does not hide it from the navigation, so if you created
a menu link then you will need to remove it.

***To hide a Dashboard:***

1. While editing the Dashboard, click on the "Misc" tab.
2. Scroll to the "Discovery" section.
3. Toggle on the switch labeled "Hidden".
4. Click the "Save" button.
