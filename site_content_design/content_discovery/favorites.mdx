Curator has the ability to mark dashboards as favorites.  Favorited dashboards will show up first on the home page once
the user logs in.

This functionality requires any authentication method other than "Pass-Through".  See the [Authentication Methods](/setup/authentication/overview)
section for more information.

If you have a [Tableau Connection](/creating_integrations/tableau_connection/creating_a_connection)
the favorites will also synchronize across to Tableau Server/Cloud.

You can also display the number of favorites a Dashboard has. This number shows up in both the Dashboard action-buttons
area when viewing a Dashboard and on the homepage when showing Dashboard tiles.
