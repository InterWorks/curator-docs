# Search

The frontend search functionality helps explore your Curator content or access specific content directly without
navigating through the menus.

<br/>
**To enable search:**

1. Navigate to the backend of the system (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`) and log in if prompted.
2. Navigate to _Settings > Curator > Portal Settings > Features > Usability_
3. Switch the toggle _Search_ on to enable search

_Note: The search toggle enables the search prompt shown in the menu. If enabled, you can also add a search bar to your
page by using [Page Builder](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/documentationpages/pages-overview/1078)_

<br/>
**What is being searched through?**

The search considers the following components to generate the search results:

1. Titles
2. Descriptions
3. Keywords
4. From version 2023.02.15 onwards: Text content on pages

*Note:* Search results reflect all permissions set on the BI Platforms or by using [Restrict Access](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/site-content-design/menus/restrict-access/1505).
In case you have added dashboards or built content that should not be visible in search results, enable the _Hidden_
toggle. To hide dashboards navigate to the _Misc_ tab and then in the _Discovery_ section you find the toggle.
To hide other types of content, the toggle is in the details pane.

<br/>
**How do results display?**

Search results show the following components:

* Thumbnail (default if none was created/ set)
* Title
* Description (if existing)
* Keywords (if existing and matching the search term; max. 2 - more are indicated by an ellipsis)
* If the result content is favorited or not

**From release 2023.02.15 onwards**: The description is only shown for Pages if there is a match in it. Otherwise, Pages
will always show a preview of their content (with or without a match).

We highlight the match from your search term in the title, description, and keywords in bold font.

<br/>
**Style your search**

Brand your search with the following settings

* Add a custom search icon (Available since 2022.11.30)
* Navigate to _Settings > Curator > Themes > Styles > Logo and Icons_ to add your own search icon
* Style the colors of your search results
* Navigate to _Settings > Curator > Themes > Search Options_ (in versions until 2022.09.28: _Settings > Curator > Portal
Settings > Styles > Search Options_) to set the background and text color
* Navigate to _Settings > Curator > Themes > Styles > Miscellaneous > Navigation Highlight Color_ (in versions until
2022.09.28: _Settings > Curator > Portal Settings > Styles > Miscellaneous > Navigation Highlight Color_) to set the
text color on hover

<br/>
**Which algorithm is under the hood?**

Our search applies a fuzzy search algorithm implemented by [fuse js](https://fusejs.io/). That way the search
can display results even if the search term includes small typos.
