When viewing a list of dashboards, Curator has the ability to display a custom preview of the Tableau Server view as a
thumbnail image.

These thumbnails can either be set manually while creating or
[editing a Dashboard](/site_content_design/pages/pages_overview) or the system will attempt to automatically grab the
thumbnail from the Tableau Server if the Dashboard is created without one.

Once the Dashboard is created you can manually refresh the thumbnail by pressing the Refresh Thumbnail button.

***To refresh the dashboards thumbnail:***

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Tableau** > **Dashboards** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "New Dashboard" button or select an existing Dashboard.
4. In the Misc tab, expand the Look/Feel section and click the "Refresh Thumbnail" button.

You can manually upload a thumbnail on the Dashboard edit page.
