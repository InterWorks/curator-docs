Whether it's storing small data-sets from around your business, getting valuable feedback from your users, or creating a
simple contact-us / request access form Curator's data manager has the web form building capabilities you need.

## Creating a Form

You can create a form on the backend using Curator's Data Manager feature.  See here for more information on how to
create forms and fields in our [Data Manager Basics](/embedding_using_analytics/data_manager/data_manager_basics)
section.

## Adding a Form to a Page

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Content** > **Pages** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Find the page you want to add your form to from the Pages list or click "New Page" to create a new page.
4. Add a new element to your page, and when the modal pops-up, click the "Analytic Element" tab and select the "Curator
Data Group" option.

5. In the Page Styles section on the left-hand side, you can choose to either embed the Form Only for receiving inputs,
or you can add the Table view to allow your end-users to see the data that has already been added.

## Forms and Tableau Dashboards on Pages

Some Tableau Dashboards can pull their results from Form submissions. In cases like this it can be useful to have the
Tableau Dashboard refresh it's data after a Form submission. Curator will automatically refresh all Tableau Dashboards
that are on a page with a Form if a Form submission occurs.
