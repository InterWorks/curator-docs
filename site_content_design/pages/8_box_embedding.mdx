## Adding Box to a Curator Page

Start by either creating a new page or editing an existing Curator page from Curator's backend.  Click on the plus (+)
icon in the Page Builder preview pane to add a new blank element to the page.  This blank element is a placeholder that
you'll use to embed the desired Box folder by following these steps:

1. Hover your mouse over the blank element and click on the pencil icon.
2. Click on the **Additional Elements** tab at the top of the pop-up.
3. Select the **BOX Cloud** option.
4. The pop-up will close and the Box settings will appear on the left.  Paste the widget you copied above into the
**Box Embed Code** field.  You should see the Page Builder preview update to show the Box folder or login screen.
5. Adjust the height as you need it by using the ***Height*** field in the Box Settings.
6. Once you're happy with the layout, click on the **Save** button.
