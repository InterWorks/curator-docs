Meta titles play a crucial role in the realm of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and website usability. When displayed
in search engine results or shared links via internal communication tools (e.g. Slack) meta titles serve as the first
impression of your content.

You can take advantage of Curator's meta title controls impacting the the meta titles for your entire site by creating
a site name, specifying a title on the home page.
*All other meta titles will be auto-generated based on the title of the content (e.g. Page Title, Dashboard Title).*

All Meta titles for individual pages will have this structure:

`Page Meta Title | Site Meta Title`

So for example, if we were to call our site "My Website", and create a page with a title of "My Page" that would result
in

`My Page | My Website`

## Changing the Site Meta Title

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Curator** > **Themes** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the Theme you'd like to modify.
4. Click on the **Brand** tab and change the *Curator Site Name* field to show the Site Name you'd like to appear on
every page.
5. Be sure to save your Theme settings.

## Changing the Homepage Page Meta Title

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Curator** > **Themes** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the Theme you'd like to modify.
4. Click on the **Home** tab and change the *Curator Home Title (Meta tag)* field to show the Homepage Name you'd like
to appear on the home page.  If you would like to have no homepage title, simply delete any text in this field.
5. Be sure to save your Theme settings.

## Changing the Page Meta Title for an individual Page

When creating a page, or analytic element (e.g. Tableau Dashboard), the Page Meta title will draw from the name of the
content given on the edit page.  The only exception to this is the homepage Meta Title which will override the page
being displayed on the homepage.  If you wish to change a Page's Meta title you must change teh Page's title itself.

## SEO Considerations

Remember that meta titles play a crucial role in SEO and determining how your website appears in search engine results.
Make sure to use relevant keywords, keep the titles concise (usually between 50-60 characters), and create compelling
titles that entice users to click through to your site. Also, check your website regularly to ensure the meta titles
are accurately representing the content and objectives of your pages.
