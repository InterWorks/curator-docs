The title and toolbar location, for most options, are dependent upon one another for the styling of your site.  While
titles help your users understand where they are and what they are looking at,  Toolbars contain the action buttons that
allow your users to interact with, filter, export and even send scheduled emails of your embedded visualization.

**NOTE**: As of now, all actions are available for Tableau Dashboards. There is no feature parity for Power BI or ThoughtSpot.
