# Homepage

Curator allows you to create unique web pages using
[Curator's page builder](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/documentationpages/pages-overview/1078) to customize
the layout and content of any page on your site.  This is particularly useful when creating your homepage to ensure
users start off with all the information they need.  By default, Curator comes installed with some sample pages, but if
you no longer have that page or want to start by creating a new page, follow the
[steps to create a page](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/documentationpages/pages-overview/1078) first.  Once
your page has been created use the steps below to set that page as your homepage.

## Setting the Homepage

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Curator** > **Theme** section from the left-hand menu. Select the Theme to apply the
new homepage to.
3. Click on the 'Home' tab at the top of the page.
4. Change the Homepage Type dropdown to **Page**.
5. Change the Homepage Page dropdown to the page you'd like to set as your homepage.
6. Click "Save" to apply your changes.
