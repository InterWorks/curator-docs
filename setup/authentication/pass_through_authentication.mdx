"Pass-Through" authentication is the default security setting in Curator. This does not mean it's recommended though -
in fact typically it's _not_ recommended as it's the lowest security setting available.  However, it allows you to
quickly get started with Curator and your analytics content, and is a good way to test out the platform before
committing to a more secure or complex authentication method, or it can be useful if you would like to use Curator
in a public-facing manner where you will have almost entirely anonymous users who may or may not have access to
<Tooltip tip={allEmbedTypes.join(', ')}>analytics content</Tooltip>.

## Changing Authentication Settings to Pass-Through

<BackendNavPath
  levelOne="Settings"
  levelTwo="Security"
  levelThree="Authentication Settings"
  tab="General"
  section="Authentication Type"
/>

Select the **Pass-Through (Security Disabled)** option and be sure to save your changes.
