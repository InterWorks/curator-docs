import { allEmbedTypes } from '/snippets/variables.mdx';

When <Tooltip tip={allEmbedTypes.join(', ')}>integrating your analytics</Tooltip> Curator relies on those source-systems
to authorize users to see and interact with content that is embedded in Curator.  However, in order to utilize those
systems that your content relies on Curator must be set up to authenticate users to the frontend of the site. Curator
can use a variety of methods to authenticate users to the frontend - each method may require additional
setup, so be sure to check out the relevant section for your established security - or reach out to our support team
using the link at the top of the page if you have questions about choosing the right method for your organization.

## Default Authentication

By default, Curator is set up to "Pass Through" authentication to your embedded content, and has no Authentication or
Authorization system in place.

When users encounter embedded content, they will be prompted to log in with their own credentials, and there will be no
menu permissions - so everyone will be able to see everything, but the source-system in question will still restrict
access to content based on the user's permissions in that system.

## Authentication Type Options

If you plan to integrate any <Tooltip tip={allEmbedTypes.join(', ')}>analytic-content</Tooltip> it's wise to get that
connection set up first.  Review the steps for [creating your integration](/creating_integrations/overview) in our
documentation, and then come back here to set up your authentication.

- [SAML](/setup/authentication/okta_saml)
This allows user accounts to authenticate using your SAML Identity Provider (IdP), such as Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc.

- **Tableau Server (needs documented)**
This allows user accounts to authenticate directly with a Tableau Server using their local Tableau Server username and password.

- [Curator Users](/setup/authentication/curator_users)
This allows users to be created and stored locally on the site. For Tableau Cloud customers you can use Curator as your
SAML Host (IdP), in which case you would set up your Tableau Cloud site to use Curator as the SAML authenticator.

- [Pass-Through (Security Disabled)](/setup/authentication/pass_through_authentication)
This turns off authentication to the frontend and makes all links and pages public.  The user is still
required to authenticate directly to the Tableau Server for any underlying views in a Dashboard which
requires a login.

- [Active Directory](/setup/authentication/active_directory)
Users authenticate seamlessly with Microsoft Active Directory - not to be confused with [Azure AD](/setup/authentication/azure_ad_saml)
which is a cloud-based service.

- **OAuth/OpenID (needs documented)**
This allows user accounts to authenticate using your OAuth provider.
