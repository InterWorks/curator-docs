This is an optional step in addition to configuring Curator for SAML authentication.  See these links for help
configuring SAML within Curator first:

## Configuring Curator to Sign SAML Requests

If your SAML Identity Provider (IdP) requires SAML requests to be signed, you'll also need to generate a certificate
and private key, and add those to Curator's authentication settings.

Here are the steps you'll need to take:

1. Generate a certificate and private key.  If needed, you can create a self-signed key [here](https://www.samltool.com/self_signed_certs.php).
2. Navigate to Curator's **Backend** > **Settings** > **Security** > **Authentication Settings** and expand the
**SAML Advanced** section.
3. Toggle on the **Sign Log In Requests** and **Sign Logout Requests** options.
4. Open the certificate file on your computer, copy its contents, and paste them into the
**Service Provider Certificate** field.
5. Open the private key file on your computer, copy its contents, and paste them into the
**Service Provider Private** Key field.
6. Save the changes.
7. You will likely need to send the certificate file to your SAML IdP administrator.
8. If the **Certificate** field (the field above the **Service Provider Certificate**) is blank, you'll need to get an
updated metadata file from your IdP administrator and import it using the button in the **General** section at the top
of the page.
