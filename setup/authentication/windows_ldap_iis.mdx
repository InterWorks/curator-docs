**Curator no longer supports IIS on new installations.**

**Only use the information below on existing installs.  It is *highly* recommended that you reinstall with Apache for
stability, please see our
[Windows Apache Installation](/setup/installation/windows_installation)
documentation for steps on how to achieve the best Curator experience for Windows.**

## LEGACY SYSTEMS ONLY

For current information on how to set up Active Directory on Windows, please see our
[Active Directory](/setup/authentication/active_directory) documentation.

Using IIS, you can use the user's AD credentials automatically.

Enable Windows Authentication in "Add/Remove Windows Features". (Sometimes this is known as Add Roles and Features)
Server Roles > Web Server (IIS) > Web Server > Security > Window Authentication.
*Note: This may be found in the Server Manager, not IIS*

Once this is added, go to your site in IIS, click "Authentication". Change "Windows Authentication" to "Enabled" and
"Anonymous Authentication" to "Disabled".

If you have issues, make sure to disable UAC, to allow access to the filesystem.  You can find this setting under
Control Panel > System and Security > User Account Control Settings.
