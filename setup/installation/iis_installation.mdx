**Curator no longer supports new installations on IIS.**

Instead, download the installer for [Windows](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/setup/installation/windows/1108).

NOTE: *If you already have IIS installed, Curator's support team will continue to support your instance, but any new
installations will require our Apache installation.  It is highly recommended that you migrate to Apache for increased
stability.*
