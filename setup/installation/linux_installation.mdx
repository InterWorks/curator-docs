The automated installer covers the vast majority of setups, but each server is different and may require
commands specific to your IT infrastructure.

This installer works with the following distributions:

* Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04 (Recommended)
* CentOS 8
* RedHat 8
* Amazon Linux AMI 2

## Installation Script

1. SSH into your web server, ensure you're using a user that has full sudo access, and run the command below:

    ```bash Install Command
    curl -s -o curator.sh https://api.curator.interworks.com/scripts/linux_install.sh && chmod +x ./curator.sh && ./curator.sh
    ```
2. After you've run the command, a file with credentials will be generated at `/var/www/curator_info.txt` - make note of these credentials.
3. Open `http://curatorexample.com/install.php` in a browser - replacing `curatorexample.com` with your site's URL.
If you're on the server you installed, you may also use `localhost`.  Keep in mind this may be an IP address or computer
name until your IT team sets up DNS.

## Custom Setup

The install script can take optional parameters to specify values for the installation script. This can be helpful in
distributed setups, or scripted installations.
    ```bash
    curl -o curator.sh https://api.curator.interworks.com/scripts/linux_install.sh
    chmod +x ./curator.sh
    ./curator.sh -f -h [database_host] -u [database_username] -p [database_password] -P [database_port] -d [database_name] -l [license_key] -s [persistent_storage_location] -v [curator_version]
    ```

Arguments:
    - `-h` The database hostname *Needed when using an external database host*
    - `-u` The database username  *Default: `curator`*
    - `-p` The database password *Default: auto-generated password.  Use this when you need to use a connection to a
    database for a user that has already been created with a specific password.*
    - `-P` The database port *Default: `3306`*
    - `-d` The database name *Default: `curator`*
    - `-l` The License Key for your Curator installation. When performing a full installation, this is required.
    - `-s` Path to a persistent storage location *Container-based or distributed installations typically require this.*
    - `-v` Sets the version of Curator to install. *Default: most recent version.*

Options:

    - `-f` Full Installation, this flag is required in most custom setups to avoid the in-browser installer.

## Advanced Setup

The automated installations install and configure LAMP environment and dependencies using standard Linux repositories.
In rare situations, a more manual installation may be required. If this is the case, reach out to your InterWorks
