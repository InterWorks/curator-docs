## Windows Installer

Log in to the server where you'd like to install Curator and [download the Curator installer for Windows](https://api.curator.interworks.com/CuratorSetup.exe).

Locate your download and right-click the file, then select "Run as Administrator" to begin the installation process

## Log Locations

These paths are dependant on your installation location, but these are the default paths:

* Apache: `C:\InterWorks\httpd_errors.log`
* PHP: `C:\InterWorks\php_errors.log`
* Installation Log: `C:\InterWorks\install.log`

## Other Information

These paths are dependant on your installation location, but these are the default paths:

* Webroot: `C:\InterWorks\htdocs`
* HTTPD Config: `C:\InterWorks\web.conf`
* PHP.ini: `C:\InterWorks\php.ini`
* Start Process: `C:\InterWorks\start.bat` (Also desktop shortcut)

## Changing the Install Path

This is _not recommended_ but may be necessary in rare circumstances. The installer will default to
`C:\InterWorks\Curator` if no changes are made to the install path. If you must change the install path, click the
"Options" button in the installer window

![Highlight options button](/docs_assets/images/setup/installation/windows_installation/click_options.png)

then change the Install Location path:

Please note that the paths above may no longer be valid if you change the install path.
