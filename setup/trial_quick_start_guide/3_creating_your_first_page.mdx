### Add an Element

An interface will popup which gives you the option to Add an Element.

The default container in your preview represents a single element. These elements can be broken down into 3 different types:

1. **Web Elements** (Text, Banners, etc)
1. **Analytic Elements** (BI Dashboards, SSRS, etc)
1. **Additional Elements** (Unrestricted HTML, Embedded URLS, etc)

After adding an element, select the element and a menu window will appear on the left side with options to change,
delete, and customize your element.

## Example: Creating a Page

Some of our most common elements are listed below

### Add a Hero Element

1. After naming your page, the first step in our sample page will be to add a Hero Element.
1. On the left menu window, select Hero Settings and select one of the template starter images.
1. Add in a Heading (e.g. ACME Sample Page) and Body Texts and Change Text Color if needed
1. Under Row Styles, update the Row Width to Full Width if the Hero Image should go across the full width.

### Add a Dashboard to a Page

Dashboards can be either set up as standalone items or embedded within a page for greater customization on the wider page.

To add a Dashboard to a page, go ahead and add an element, select Analytic Elements and add your desired Dashboard to
replace the element.

**Note:** If the Analytics Element is unavailable to be selected, please add the relevant connection.
