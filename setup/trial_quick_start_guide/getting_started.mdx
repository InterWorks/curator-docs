## First Steps

You’ve just reached out to an InterWorks Account Executive and have had a free trial set up.

You should have received an email that looks like this:
![trial screen](https://curator.interworks.com/file/trial-screen)

## Front End vs Admin

The front-end login will direct you to your portal and show you what your end users will see.  The default URL should
appear as `companyname.portals.interworks.com` and is fully customizable.

The admin login will lead you to administrative settings and the URL should appear as
`companyname.portals.interworks.com/backend`. The administrative settings are where you will build your analytics portal,
control your authentication, and manage your users.

Click on the Admin login and continue to the Admin Settings below.

## Admin Settings

After entering your username and password, you should enter a screen that looks like this:
![Curator home Dashboard](https://curator.interworks.com/file/curator-home-dashboard)

### Admin Menu Options

To the left, you’ll see the menu options. They are categorized into 4 sections.

1. **Content:** Pages, files and navigation
2. **Tableau:** Dashboards, filters and parameters
3. **Integrations:** Tableau Server connections and user group syncs
4. **Settings:** Curator settings, upgrades, security and users

### Update your Account Information and Password

In a Curator trial? Go ahead and navigate to the next page on Setting Up Your Portal. If you change your trial
credentials then we will not be able to easily troubleshoot issues for you!

If you are working on setting up your own instance, then go ahead and update your account information and password from
the defaults.

To do this, click on your icon on the top right, and update your First Name, Last Name, and Password.
