Need to update PHP, Apache, or MariaDB on your webserver?
Curator's upstream dependencies need to be upgraded every so often as well!

*Note: Before upgrading any dependencies, it is a good idea to ensure that you have a recent Curator backup available.*

## Windows

First and foremost: ensure all relevant Windows Updates have been applied to your server.

Next, update Curator dependencies.

Curator bundles PHP and Apache upgrades into a simple utility package to make updating them as easy as possible.

To update Curator's dependencies, simply download our **[Curator Dependency Update Utility](https://portals.interworks.com/Curator_PHP_Upgrade_Util.exe)**.

Once downloaded, simply double-click the utility to run updates.
PHP and Apache will be upgraded automatically by this utility.

**Note: Internet access is required for this process. Systems without internet access will need to upgrade manually.**

To manually upgrade PHP, Apache, or MariaDB, download these utilities using the following links:

1. [PHP](https://api.curator.interworks.com/file/php_apache)
2. [Apache](https://api.curator.interworks.com/file/apache)
3. [MariaDB](https://api.curator.interworks.com/file/mariadb)

*Note:* To upgrade MariaDB, you will need your root database password.
If you do not know this password, check your installation directory for an *Curator.txt* file, which contains
the default credentials.

### MariaDB on Windows

To upgrade MariaDB on Windows, first stop the *CuratorDB* Service, using Window's *Services* app.

You can open Window's *Services* by simply searching for *Services* using the Window's start bar.

To stop the *CuratorDB* process, find it in the *Services* list, then right click on it and click *Stop*.

Next, find Curator's MariaDB installation folder.

*Note:* This can usually be found in C:\InterWorks\Curator\libs\MariaDB.

Rename to MariaDB's *bin* folder to *bin.bkp*.

After a successful upgrade, you can delete this backup directory.

Then, download the latest [MariaDB](https://api.curator.interworks.com/file/mariadb) package.
Unzip this package over top of Curator's MariaDB installation.

Finally, open PowerShell in Administrative mode and run MariaDB's upgrade utility.
To open Powershell in Administrative mode, use the search widget in Window's start bar.
Search for Powershell, then Right-Click on Powershell and click "Run As Administrator".

Navigate to MariaDB's bin directory and run the upgrade utility.

```bash
cd C:\InterWorks\Curator\libs\MariaDB\bin
mysql_upgrade_service.exe --service=CuratorDB
```

Note: if you have trouble with the MariaDB's *service* upgrade utility, you can also use the non-service version.
To do this, first restart MariaDB in Window's *Services* app, and then run this command:

```bash
mysql_upgrade.exe -u root -p --force
```

## Linux

Linux's upstream repositories handle dependency updates, so first ensure you are running a recent version of your Linux distribution.

If you're not sure, you can take a look at our recommended distributions on the [Linux Installation page](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/setupinstallation/linux/1040).

To update Curator's Linux dependencies, SSH into your web server and cd into the webroot directory
(typically /var/www/html) and ensure you're using a user that has full sudo access, and run the command below.

This command will upgrade PHP, MariaDB, Apache, and any other operating system dependencies required by Curator:

```bash
curl -s -o php_upgrade_util.sh https://api.curator.interworks.com/scripts/php_upgrade_util.sh && chmod +x ./php_upgrade_util.sh && ./php_upgrade_util.sh
```
