If you've installed Curator on a server that is cut off from internet access, we provide a Manual Update
option. This requires enabling the Disable Curator Upgrades setting to be enabled so you can perform a Manual
Upgrade.

***To enable Allow Manual Curator Upgrades:***

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `https://curator.example.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** section using the left-hand menu..
3. Click on the "Features" tab at the top of the main page content.
4. If "Disable Curator Upgrades" is set to OFF, click the switch to turn this feature ON
5. Click to switch the "Allow Manual Curator Upgrades" setting ON under the "Functionality" section and click
the "Save" button.
