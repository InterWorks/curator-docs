There are several easy ways to update Curator.

To see if Curator needs an update, check the status of your Curator instance on the homepage of the backend,
or on the System Upgrade page.

The "Current Version" will show what software version Curator is currently running and the "Latest Version"
will show the latest release available.

**Attention: We recommend taking a Curator Backup before an upgrade. More details can be found [here](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/documentation/system-administration/curator-backup/1095).**

## Troubleshooting

***Having Issues With the Upgrade?*** Try our [Upgrade Troubleshooting Documentation](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/documentation/upgrading/troubleshooting-upgrades/1258).

## Multi-version Upgrades (4+ versions)

We recommend upgrading no more than 3 versions at a time.

If you plan to make an upgrade to a Curator instance that is more than 4 versions out-of-date, use the
version-specific upgrades on the upgrade page, instead of the "One-click upgrade".
