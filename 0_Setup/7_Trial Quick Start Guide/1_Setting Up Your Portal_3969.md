# Setting Up Your Portal

Click on **Settings → Curator → Themes → Main Theme**

Click on the Main Theme **Global Theme** to edit our global theme

A live view of your Curator site will appear on the screen. We recommend logging into the front end on a separate screen
before making any changes so that you can see the changes you make on your Curator site. Keep in mind that your admin
account is separate from the front end accounts. Your credentials may be different based on how you choose to
authenticate your users. If you are not able to log into the front end then click **Settings** → **Security** →
**Authentication Settings** to see how your front end user credentials are being pulled in.

  * Curator is flexible with image sizes but we recommend wider over taller logos
  * Logo padding by entering pixels or percentages (Ex: 15px or 20%)
    * Tip: use negative padding if you are trying to increase the size of your image
