# Multifactor Authentication

If your Curator system is using a Curator-based authentication form, multifactor authentication is available utilizing
Google Authenticator.

After enabling multifactor authentication, users will be prompted to setup the Authenticator application using a QR
code. For more information on the frontend user interface, see our
[feature demo video](https://curator.interworks.com/page/curator-new-feature-spotlight-multi-factor-authentication).

## Curator Setup

1. To enabled MFA, go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Authentication**.
2. In "Customization", toggle "ON" the Multi-factor Authentication switch.
3. Save these settings
4. Now, all users will be prompted to setup and use multifactor authentication after their next login.
