In our project, it's crucial that our documentation stays in sync with our marketing site. This ensures that our users
always have the most up-to-date information about Curator.

## Local Development

Follow the instructions to install the [Mintlify CLI](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart#install-the-cli).

Once you have the CLI installed, you can use it to run the documentation server locally by cd-ing into the documentation
folder and running mintlify. From the root of your Curator project:

```bash
cd documentation
mint dev
```

## Global Settings

Mintlify is organized by the `docs.json` file.  Read more about
[setting up your docs.json file](https://mintlify.com/docs/settings#setting-up-your-docs-json) on Mintlify's website.

## Components

[Mintlify supports components](https://mintlify.com/docs/text) that can be used to enhance your documentation.

## Documentation syncing process

Once a new Curator release has been created, a gitlab pipeline will kick off that replicates all the files from within
the `documentation` folder to the [Curator docs repo on GitHub](https://github.com/InterWorks/curator-docs). This will
then trigger a Github action to deploy the updated documentation to
[https://docs.curator.interworks.com](https://docs.curator.interworks.com).
