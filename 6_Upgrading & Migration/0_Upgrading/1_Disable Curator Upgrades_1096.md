# Disable Curator Upgrades

Curator can be set up on a server that does not have access to outside networks. When you have this setup it
is advised to Disable Upgrades. This will prevent any issues if someone accidentally clicks the upgrade
button when Curator can't reach an out of network connection.

***To enable Disable Curator Upgrades:***

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. <https://curator.example.com/backend>).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** section using the left-hand menu..
3. Click on the "Features" tab at the top of the main page content.
4. Click to switch on the "Disable Curator Upgrades" setting under the "Functionality" section and click the "Save" button.
