Curator enables you to embed Power BI reports as a seamless part of your portal, providing your users with a unified
analytics experience, streamlining access to critical insights.

## Prerequisites

Before adding Power BI reports to Curator, ensure you have
[established your Power BI connection](/creating_integrations/power_bi_connection/curator_connection) and have reports
published to a Power BI workspace.

## Creating a Power BI Report in Curator

To add a new Power BI report to your Curator portal follow the steps below:

### Navigate to Power BI Reports

1. <BackendNavPath
      levelOne="Power BI"
      levelTwo="Reports"
   />
2. Click the **New Report** button
   <Frame>
      <img
         className="rounded-xl"
         src="/assets/images/embedding_using_analytics/power_bi_reports/pbi_report_new_report_empty_list_page.png"
         alt="Add new Power BI report from list page"
      />
   </Frame>
3. Fill out the details in the **Create Power BI Report** form:
   <Frame>
      <img
         className="rounded-xl"
         src="/assets/images/embedding_using_analytics/power_bi_reports/pbi_create_new_report_edit_report_page.png"
         alt="Create new Power BI report"
      />
   </Frame>

   - **Workspace**: Select the Power BI workspace containing the report.
   - **Report**: Select the specific report to embed.
   - **Title**: This appears in navigation menus and page titles - can be different from the Power BI report name.

The display options will allow you to control the appearance of the toolbar, the persistence of filters, the appearance
of the filter pane as well as the Power BI report Page Navigation.

Optionally, explore the Discovery and Display tabs to further customize how the report appears and is found by users
or linked to other content across your site.

Be sure to save your report before navigating away from the page.

## Adding Reports to Navigation

After creating a report, [add it to your site's menu](/site_content_design/menus/menu_items) for easy access and
automated authorization.

## Adding Reports to Pages

Once a Power BI Report has been added to Curator it can also be added to pages for a more dynamic layout.  Embed Power
BI reports in custom pages [using the Page Builder](/site_content_design/pages/power_bi_report).

## Security Considerations

Curator utilizes the permissions set within your Power BI tenant including both workspace-level permissions as well as
direct-access permissions.

### Workspace-Level Access

When a user has access to a workspace, they automatically have access to all reports within that workspace.
Curator checks workspace access to determine report visibility.  Due to performance concerns we strongly recommend
utilizing workspace-level access whenever possible.

### Direct Report Access

If a user does not have access to a workspace, Curator will check for direct access permissions to individual reports. This
allows for more granular control over report access but can lead to performance issues due to limitations in the Power
BI APIs.
