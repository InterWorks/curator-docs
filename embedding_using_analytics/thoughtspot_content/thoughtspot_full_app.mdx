If you have [integrated ThoughtSpot](
    /creating_integrations/thoughtspot_connection/integrating_thoughtspot_with_curator
), you can follow this guide to add a ThoughtSpot Full App Embed to Curator.

## Creating the ThoughtSpot Full App Embed

The ThoughtSpot Full App Embed is available directly in the Page Builder, allowing you to embed the complete
 ThoughtSpot application experience within your Curator pages.

1. <BackendNavPath
    levelOne="Content"
    levelTwo="Pages"
    /> Find the page you'd like to add your embed to, or create a new page.
2. In the Page Builder, select an existing element from the preview and click the "Change Element" button. You can also
 add a new element.
3. Choose the "Analytic Elements" category then the "THOUGHTSPOT FULL APP" element.

4. Once the element is added, choose the Org where your ThoughtSpot data lives from the left-hand panel:

5. Finally choose the Homepage experience you'd like to use:
    ![Search bar dropdown](/docs_assets/images/thoughtspot/full_app_embed_page_builder_search_bar_dropdown.png)
    - **Classic Homepage** (default) - The traditional ThoughtSpot homepage experience

    - **Spotter Homepage** - ThoughtSpot's new natural language search interface

## Adding the ThoughtSpot Full App Embed to the Curator Frontend

Once configured in the Page Builder, the ThoughtSpot Full App Embed will be displayed on your page, providing users
 with access to the complete ThoughtSpot application interface. Users will need appropriate ThoughtSpot permissions
  on the configured Org to access the embedded application.

You can make the page containing the Full App Embed more discoverable by:

1. Adding it to your [navigation](/site_content_design/menus/managing_menus).
2. Creating a [tile](/site_content_design/pages/Tiles) that links to the page.
3. Adding keywords to the page so it can be easily found via Curator's search or in the [explorer](
    /site_content_design/pages/Explorer
).
