In order to gather valuable insights from your audience about their experience using your Dashboards, Curator can
provide a simple and easy feedback mechanism for your users to submit their feedback, questions, and requests.  After
following the [Creating a Form](/embedding_using_analytics/data_manager/creating_a_form)
outline to build out your desired form, follow the guide below to integrate the Dashboard feedback in to your Dashboard
pages.

## Modifying your for to support the Dashboard URL

In order to gather the context of which Dashboard a user is providing feedback for, you'll need to add a new hidden
field that will store the Dashboard URL (the Curator URL).

### Adding a new Data Attribute

To add this attribute to your form:

1. Go to Data Manager > Data Attributes to set up the fields you want:

2. In the Create Attribute page, set the name, description (optional), and the field type.
3. Make sure the field type is set to **Short Text**.

Next, navigate to your Data Manager Group, and associate the Attribute you just created with your Group.

### Identifying the form to use in Portal Settings

There's one last step to set up your Dashboard Feedback.

1. Navigate to Settings > Tableau > Tableau Server Settings.
2. Find the Dashboard Feedback on the General tab.
3. For the **Feedback Form** select your Data Group.
4. For the **Dashboard URL** select the Short Text Data Attribute you created to store the the Dashboard URL.
