There may be occasional issues when generating reports using Curator's Scheduled Reports.  This can be for a variety of
reasons, such as bad Tableau Server configuration, networking interruptions, permission changes, or dashboards getting
moved/deleted.  To handle these scenarios, the majority of them are fixed by simply having your user log back in to
Curator, and re-create the slide.  See the steps below on how to update the existing "Fallback Image" if you'd like to
customize this for your users.

## Updating the Fallback Image

Before you proceed below, you need to upload your file using the [File](/site_content_design/files/files)
system in Curator.

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** section from the left-hand menu.
3. Click on the "Report Builder" tab at the top of the main page content.
4. Expand the "Report Builder E-Mail Settings" and update the Fallback Image.
5. Click the save button.
