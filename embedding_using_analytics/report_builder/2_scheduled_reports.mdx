# Scheduled Reports

The Scheduled Reports feature allows you to set a report to be sent out via email on a recurring schedule. This feature
requires that the
[Report Builder](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/embedding-using-analytics/report-builder/overview-and-enabling/1050)
and
[Report Builder: Email Option](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/embedding-using-analyticsreport-builder/email-option/1052)
both be turned on.

As of the 2024.09-02 release, [Scheduled Reports](https://curator.interworks.com/page/kb/embedding-using-analyticsreport-builder/email-option/1052)
now have an unsubscribe option.  Recipients who receive the email can remove themselves from the distribution list -
unless they are the only recipient, in which case the report needs to be deleted to cease distribution via the schedule.
