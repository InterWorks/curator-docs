# Generating Titles

When viewing dashboards via Curator, you can choose whether or not the page title is retrieved from the name you have
entered in the edit-Dashboard page or the name of the Dashboard on Tableau Server.

## Specify where your Dashboard titles are retrieved from

1. Login to the backend of your Curator instance (e.g. `http://curatorexample.com/backend`).
2. Navigate to the **Settings** > **Curator** > **Portal Settings** section from the left-hand menu.
3. In the Features tab, expand the Usability section and find the *Use Curator Dashboard Titles* switch.
4. Toggle the switch to enable/disable *Use Curator Dashboard Titles* and click the "Save" button.
