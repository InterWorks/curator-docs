Curator allows users to subscribe to dashboards where updates to the underlying Tableau Server views will be emailed to
them on a set schedule.

## Known Limitations

There is currently a limitation in Tableau's APIs that make subscribing to Custom Views unavailable for embedded
applications.  Curator can only create a subscription to the Dashboard's default view through Tableau's subscription
engine.  However,
[Report Builder](/embedding_using_analytics/report_builder/overview_and_enabling_report_builder)
supports subscriptions to Custom Views.

This functionality requires that the Tableau Server REST API is enabled. This allows you to subscribe to a Dashboard or
to the workbook the Dashboard belongs to on the associated Tableau Server.  See the
[Tableau Connection Setup](/creating_integrations/tableau_connection/creating_a_connection)
section for more information.
